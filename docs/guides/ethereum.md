## [Metamask ðŸ¦Š](https://metamask.io/)

Metamask allows you to use Ethereum based applications in your browser. The [website](https://metamask.io/) has a video showing how it works. The TL;DR: go to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), download [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn), open it up and follow the instructions. Write down all the passwords and passphrases you use. If you lose them, you'll lose all your tokens and need to start from scratch with another account. This is important. Any problems you have should be directed at the Metamask team as they are more familiar with their product than anyone else.

## [Rinkeby ðŸ“¥](https://faucet.rinkeby.io)

Rinkeby is a test network for Ethereum. It's free to get tokens and they're not worth anything beyond sentimental value. You cannot exchange them for real ETH or anything else. What happens on Rinkeby stays on Rinkeby. 
We're currently using Rinkeby to test our DAO. You can visit the [faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io) to get some free tokens. This usually works, but if you have difficulties or don't have the social media accounts they require, just say hi on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/1hive) in the #general channel and we'll help you out ðŸ˜Š
